# All My Notes from my Kinesiology Degree - 3rd and 4th Year

These are all my notes from when I first started my Anki journey to now. I still use Anki daily for everything that I do. At this point, I don't even write notes anymore. In class, I just write questions and answers that I could format into Anki cards, transfer them into Anki later and then delete those other notes.

## Why I use Anki

Anki is a revolutionary data bank for everything that I would have forgotten. Before I used to have written notes on paper and online. However I would never look at them after my class was over.

Anki allows me to store all my data in a centralized area AS WELL AS automating the learning process with its built in spaced reptition.

**I even use Anki for daily things I learn in my day to day!**
