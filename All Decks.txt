Are you in favor of the EIM approach?&nbsp; Would you use this approach in your professional practice to motivate your clients/patients to become more physically active?&nbsp; Please explain your answer.<div><br></div><div>{{c1::<div>Yes, I am in favor of EIM. Despite the notion of adherence with prescribing exercise as medicine, it will still give them some sort of benefits compared to nothing at all. In regards to certain populations not being able to be physically active, or being active puts them at risk, I agree then that they should not be doing exercise. However, for most people, I would recommend exercise or to those that have the ability to be physically active. I believe trying out the non-medicated and low-risk prescription of exercise should come first, before prescribing medication to reduce risk and such.</div><div><br></div><div>It would also be great if medical practitioners would be able to refer or transfer a patient to an exercise trainer who has more experience. Similar to how a family doctor can refer a patient to a certain surgeon. I believe that way, it would make the system more integrated, and if the patient has access to this option, it may increase adherence, as well as allow people who need adaptations to have a professional work around them.</div>}}<br></div>	Cairney, McGannon, &amp; Atkinson (2018) describe 3 major taken-for-granted assumptions that the EIM approach is based on (please see the second required reading).<br><br>1) Briefly summarize each of these 3 assumptions.<div>1.

What and where is stress? (Challenge #1 - Segerstrom)<div><br></div><div>{{c1::Stress can be defined as ‘external events or conditions that affect the organism. This includes physiological stressors like heat, cold, and exertion as well as psychological stressors such as disease diagnosis and treatments. Role changes (transition of life) seems to be the most important stressors because of their significant downstream effects (in their personal life and other people’s lives as well - social disruption). This downstream effect is best explained using the resource model of stress where fewer resources are predictive of further loss and therefore increases our stress even more. Another popular approach - the Appraisal Approach (Lazarus) focuses on whether we determine the event to be a threat or not. This can explain why two different people may respond differently to the same stressor. It can also tell us about stressors on appraisals of subsequent events.}}</div><div><br></div><div>Why is it a challenge?</div><div><br></div><div>{{c1::Stress is the basis (stressors), response (stress), and cause (distress) all in itself.

<b>1) Why might there be changes in the experience of loneliness over the life span?&nbsp;</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>{{c1::<div>As we grow older, we tend to meet new people and learn new experiences on life. Compared to when we were a child, our feelings of social isolation and loneliness is greatly diminished. Also partly because we are forced to interact with others now. I would say children have high notions of loneliness because as was stated “loneliness is the perceived threat of the environment to the self which creates a positive feedback loop”. As a child, everything is new, wondrous, but also dangerous which can accumulate into emotions like loneliness and such. That’s what it is such a critical time for a child.&nbsp;</div><br><div>And the other spectrum, like a U-shape curve, elderly also seem to be sanction to symptoms of loneliness. This may be due to loss and grief. I would say that the more you grow older, the more you lose and remember. The more you undergo perseverative cognition. Friends leave you, spouses gone, and there is a lot of nostalgia mixed in with every little thing you do. It may feel like all your real friends have left you behind already.</div>}}<b><br></b><br></div>		HEED_321::Required_Reading::Hawkley_Cacioppo_2010
<b>2) Are there any social experiences at the root of social isolation?&nbsp;</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>{{c1::would say yet. The name literally has “social” in there. Different social experiences, be it positive or negative may be impactful to how social isolation is played out. For example, if a person has a particularly bad experience socially like making a fool of himself in front of everyone, that person may not want to be around people anymore in fear of it happening again which would cause social isolation. On the other hand, social experiences are also positive like hanging out with friends and such. We can also talk about bad relationships and abusive/toxic relationships in the argument of social experiences at the root of social isolation. However, we must know that everyone is different thus it might not be a social experience thing but it might just be personality and genes. Though I feel like social experiences play a large part if not the majority of social isolation symptoms}}<b><br></b></div>		HEED_321::Required_Reading::Hawkley_Cacioppo_2010
<b>3) If it is known that social isolation is present, what kind of interventions are possible? Which would you recommend?</b><div><br></div><div>{{c1::<div>My very first intervention would be to slowly integrate social experiences to the individual like having a friend come over weekly or watching shows together. Interactions where you don’t need to talk but just have someone present. Also, online interactions/friends (playing games) could be a large help as a first intervention. This is because there is more protection to the individual such that they feel less threat from the environment from the safety of their own home. Then slowly integrate them to in person interactions and such. I would say that the worst thing to do is force someone to hang out somewhere if they don’t want to. This causes feeling of discomfort and threat which may be counterproductive (from personal experience).&nbsp;</div><br><div>Speaking from the article, there are 4 major interventions possible.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>1. Enhancing social skills</div><div>2. Providing social skills</div><div>3. Increasing opportunities for social interaction</div><div>4.

This is because in most studies at least one of the factors (eg: subjective norms in TPB) didn’t predict behaviour. Ajzen argues that this is not even important because these factors should vary from population to population and behaviour to behaviour (already stated in the theory I guess). Also, it can be disproved, simply if none of the three factors or even if 2 of the factors do not correlate. Also they also say that yea sure there is some unexplained variance but that didn’t stop the theory from having favourable results.</span></div><br><div>Is the Theory True By Definition?</div><div><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of Ogden’s concerns is that PBC and intention are so similar that there almost always will be a correlation between them. However, what was stated above, just the notion that there is variance between these variables indicates strong individual indicators.</span></div><br><div><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another concern is that a lot of the models use subjective measures instead of objective measures which will lead to cognitive bias. However, Ajzen argues that self-reports are pretty fking good already and are good indicators for some behaviours (eg: condom use) while bad with others (eg: drinking and driving). But essentially objective measures are just too difficult and expensive to do while also might change behaviour even more then just a simple self-report!</span></div><br><div>Do Questionnaires Assess Or Create Cognitions?</div><div><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The last challenge that Ogden brings up is that the questionnaires will change the way the participants will think in itself. First of all, this concern is common in all questionnaires in general. Ajzen argues that there is no evidence that questionnaires changes later cognitions and if so, it was very little. Also, if the questionnaires were done appropriately, then cognition change would already be put at a minimum.</span></div><br><div><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Whether, in a given study, questionnaire completion has biased self-reports of behavior, has changed cognitions, or has influenced later behavior are empirical questions that cannot be answered by speculation.”</span></div></b><br>"	HEED_321::Required_Reading::Ogen_2003
