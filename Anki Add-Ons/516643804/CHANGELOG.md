## [2.1.0] - 2020-02-20

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/frozen-fields/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

### Changed

- Improved inter-addon compatibility (thanks to [Arthur](https://github.com/Arthur-Milchior/) and [BlueGreenMagick](https://github.com/BlueGreenMagick))

## [2.0.2] - 2019-04-23

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/frozen-fields/releases/tag/v2.0.2)

Please note that the field handling in Anki's editor has been subject to a lot of changes in recent releases. Because of that, Frozen Fields for Anki 2.1 will only work well on Anki 2.1.12 and up. If you are experiencing issues with the editor formatting please make sure to upgrade your Anki version before filing a bug report.

### Fixed

- Fixed field display issues on Anki 2.1.12 (#12, thanks to @ijgnd for the report!)

## [2.0.1] - 2019-04-02

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/frozen-fields/releases/tag/v2.0.1)

### Fixed

- Fixed addition of line breaks in recent versions of Anki 2.1 (#11, thanks to z1lc for the report!)
- Fixed JS console errors (#7, thanks to ijgnd for the report!)

## [2.0.0] - 2018-02-25

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/frozen-fields/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

This is the first public release of my fork of Tiago Barroso's *Frozen Fields* add-on. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of what he has done for the Anki community over the years.

This update is meant to carry on his legacy by adding Anki 2.1 support, refactoring some parts of the codebase, and fixing a few smaller issues. All of this was made possible through the generous support of a fellow Anki user who would like to remain anonymous.

### Added

- Anki 2.1 compatibility
- Hotkey for toggling all fields (default: `Shift+F9`)
- Configurable hotkeys

### Changed

- Field toggles only appear when adding notes (having them available in the browser or while editing cards didn't make much sense)

### Fixed

-  Fix rare instances of snowflake icon being pasted into fields (thanks to [Dmitry Mikheev](https://github.com/ankitest/)!)
