## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2020-04-30

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1)

### Added

- Added support for **Anki 2.1.24** and up (database access, new hook system, new finder extensions)

### Fixed

- Improved **timezone handling**. This should hopefully fix some of the issues users were experiencing around DST changes. If you are still experiencing issues [please let me know](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/issues/71). Troubleshooting timezone-related problems [is hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY), so I'm grateful for every additional tester that can help replicate things (#71)
- Fixed **daily average** calculation towards beginning of streaks (#40, #50)
- Improved assignment of forecasts to calendar days
- Added a workaround for an Anki bug present on 2.1.14 and lower

### Changed

- **Dropped support for Anki 2.0** (thus the major add-on version bump)
- Added debugging utilities that allow users to submit detailed debug logs when troubleshooting
- Added link to changelog in options screen
- **Removed the `seen:` query phrase**. This had been deprecated in the past, and with Anki 2.1.24 now no longer supporting addon-provided queries for filtered decks, it no longer made sense to keep it.

## [0.7.0-beta.1] - 2018-10-28

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/releases/tag/v0.7.0-beta.1)

<center><img src="screenshots/0.7.0_logo.png"></center>

### Added

- Full **Anki 2.1 support** (and 2.0 backwards compatibility)
    - Yes, it's finally here!
- **Completely reworked months mode**
    - shows a **continuous timeline** of activity, instead of being bound to a yearly schedule
    - more **granular insight** into monthly activity, and activity by weekday
- A **multitude of new options**, granting you more control over your stats than ever before:
    - the ability to set a **starting date** for the heatmap
    - the ability to **exclude certain decks** from being tracked
    - an option to **exclude deleted cards** from your stats
    - the ability to set a custom hotkey to toggle the heatmap
- **Secondary actions** when **Shift-clicking** heatmap **buttons**:
    - quickly move to the very beginning of your review history
    - quickly move to the last scheduled review
    - instantly change the display mode or color theme
    - and more!
- **Support** for the **[Night Mode](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067) add-on**
    - all **themes** now come with beautiful **night mode versions** that are automatically switched on when Night Mode is active (requires Night Mode version 2.2.3 and up)
    - special thanks to [Micha≈Ç Krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski) for laying the groundwork on Night Mode's side!
- A **beautiful new UI** with updated buttons, new tooltips, and more polish than ever before

### Changed

- **Completely rewrote** the add-on. Review Heatmap's codebase hadn't really changed that much since the add-on' first release nearly two years ago. This rewrite, although arduous and very time-consuming, was long overdue and now provides a stable and maintainable base for future additions to Review Heatmap.
- Fully **redesigned options dialog**, which can now also be accessed directly from the heatmap.
- On Anki 2.1 the heatmap now loads asynchronously, i.e. without blocking page load, which should make for faster switching between Anki's screens even with long review histories
- History and forecast limits are now inactive by default. The previous default of limiting the displayed data to a period of 365 days could be confusing sometimes.

### Fixed

- Fixed a series of elusive bugs surrounding different time-zones, daily cutoff settings, and other date mismatches (#23)
- Fixed incompatibilities with the Night Mode add-on (#9)
- Fixed view scrolling sometimes not working (#16)
- Fixes some macOS- and Windows-specific layout and sizing issues
- Quite a few other smaller issues which would take too long to list here


### Deprecated

- the `seen:` query phrase has been superseded by the new `rid:` phrase, and is likely to be removed in the future

### Other

- Throughout the redesign of Review Heatmap I had to develop a completely new set new tools for building and testing my add-ons. The fruits of this work will also benefit my other projects, making for a faster iteration time, and more 2.1 add-on releases coming soon!
- Review Heatmap and all of the other add-ons I'm working on are now tested against all platforms supported by Anki. If you are a macOS or Windows user you should see a lot of improvements in ironing out platform-specific kinks in the future.


## [0.6.1-anki21-alpha] - 2018-09-23

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/releases/tag/v0.6.1-anki21-alpha)

### Added

- cursory Anki 2.1 support

### Fixed

- A number of smaller bug fixes and improvements

## [0.6.0] - 2017-02-19
### Note

**Important**: As this version uses a new file structure you will have to remove older versions of the add-on before installing it.


### Added
- Toggle heatmap display on the deck browser and overview pages by using CTRL + R

### Changed
- New modularized add-on structure which should make maintenance easier


## [0.5.2] - 2017-01-15
### Fixed
- Fix review count tooltips for counts over 999 (#3)

## [0.5.1] - 2017-01-11
### Fixed
- Fix an error in the calculation of "days learned" (thanks to David Bailey!)

## [0.5.0] - 2017-01-10
### Added
- Stats on average review counts and days learned, each graded with a custom color scale
- Customizable calendar modes - display the days as a continuous year, or split them up into months
- Customizable color schemes - choose between 5 different color palettes
- You can now decide where the heatmap will appear
- All of the above and all other settings can now be contolled through an options menu
- The heatmap will also appear in the stats window now. This one is unaffacted by any limits and follows the interval settings set in the stats window.

### Changed

- Limit heatmap data range to 365 days for past reviews and 90 for pending reviews by default. This should improve performance on lower-end machines. These limits can be lifted in the options menu.

### Fixed

- Fix negative pending review counts (thanks to David Bailey!)

## 0.2.0 - 2017-01-01
### Changed
- Switched to relative scaling and scoring of user activity

## 0.1.0 - 2016-12-31
