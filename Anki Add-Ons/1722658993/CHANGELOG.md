## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-02

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/puppy-reinforcement/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

It took them a while to waddle up the version step with their tiny legs, but the puppies are finally here! Here is everything that's new in Puppy Reinforcement v1.0.0:

### Added

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glutanimate/puppy-reinforcement/master/screenshots/addcards.gif)

- Anki 2.1 compatibility (thanks to @zjosua for his help with this!, #77)
- Optional support for showing puppies while creating new cards. Controlled by the `count_adding` option in the settings (thanks to @zjosua for the implementation and /u/xTheKezio / @ijgnd for the idea, #12)
- Support for more image file types and case-insensitive file extension detection
- A more advanced randomization approach that spreads the chances of particular images being drawn up evenly (#8)

### Fixed

- Added workaround for add-on import bug present in Anki versions <= 2.1.14
- Print "card" instead of "cards" if count singular

### Changed

- Rewrote large parts of the add-on, making it a lot more maintainable for the future
- Dropped Anki 2.0 support (legacy versions remain downloadable on AnkiWeb / GitHub)
- Added support for the new add-on hooks system that will be introduced with the upcoming Anki 2.1.20 release. This should make the add-on fairly future-proof.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2020-02-05

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/puppy-reinforcement/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2)

### Fixed

- Fixed compatibility with Visual Feedback and other add-ons using newer versions of libaddon
- Print "card" instead of "cards" if count singular

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/puppy-reinforcement/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha.1)

**Important note**: As this release completely overhauls the add-on structure, you will have to uninstall any existing versions of the add-on before updating. Otherwise you might end up with duplicate versions of the add-on that would interfere with each other. *If you have customized the add-on with your own pictures or other adjustments, please make sure to back them up before deleting the old version!*
